# Matrix Operations

This repository contains implementations of common matrix operations in C++.  
The programs take user input for the matrix size and elements, then perform the selected operation.

## Operations Included

1. **Matrix Addition** – Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.  
2. **Matrix Multiplication** – Multiplies two matrices if dimensions are compatible.  
3. **Transpose of a Matrix** – Flips the matrix over its diagonal.
4. **Determinant Calculation** – Finds the determinant of a 3×3 matrix.  
5. **Symmetric Matrix Check** – Checks if the matrix is equal to its transpose.  
6. **Identity Matrix Check** – Checks if the matrix is an identity matrix.  
7. **Sparse/Dense Matrix Check** – Determines whether a matrix has more zero elements (sparse) or non-zero elements (dense).  
8. **Saddle Point Finder** – Finds an element that is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column.
